*Example: $150,000 due from Smith Family for progress billing.*

### Accrual Accounting

---

## B

### Balance Sheet

### Billings in Excess of Costs
A liability account showing when you've billed more than you've earned based on percentage of completion. Also called "overbilling."

*Example: A $75,000 backhoe is capitalized as a fixed asset and depreciated over 7 years.*

### Cash Basis Accounting
Recording revenue when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid. Not recommended for construction (use accrual instead).

An asset account showing when costs incurred exceed billings to date. Also called "underbilling."
*Example: Costs of $80,000 incurred but only billed $60,000 = $20,000 costs in excess.*

### Cost-to-Cost Method
Calculating percentage of completion by dividing costs incurred to date by total estimated costs.
*Formula: Costs to Date ÷ Total Estimated Costs = % Complete*

## D
