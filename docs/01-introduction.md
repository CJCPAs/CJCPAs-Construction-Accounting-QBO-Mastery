## Why Construction Accounting is Different

Construction accounting isn't like regular business bookkeeping. Here's why:

### 🏗️ Long-Term Contracts
Unlike a retail store that sells products the same day, construction projects span months or years. This creates unique challenges:
- **Revenue Recognition**: When do you "earn" the money?
- **Cost Matching**: How do you match costs to the revenue they generate?
- **Cash Flow vs. Profit**: Cash received ≠ Revenue earned

### 📊 The Matching Principle
**GAAP Requirement**: Expenses must be matched to the revenues they help generate in the same accounting period.

**In Plain English**: If you spend $50,000 on materials for a job in January, but you bill the customer in March, when should that $50,000 show as an expense? The answer depends on your revenue recognition method.

### 🔄 Multiple Revenue Recognition Methods

| Method | When to Use | Key Principle |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Completed Contract** | Short projects (<12 months), small contracts | Revenue recognized when project is 100% complete |
| **Percentage of Completion (POC)** | Longer projects, larger contracts | Revenue recognized proportionally as work progresses |
| **Cost-to-Cost** | Most common POC method | % Complete = Costs Incurred ÷ Total Estimated Costs |

## What Makes This Guide Different

### Every HOW Links to a WHY

Throughout this guide, you'll see this pattern:

> **HOW**: Set up class tracking for each job
> 
> **WHY**: Class tracking in QBO enables job-level profit/loss reporting, which is essential for calculating percentage of completion and identifying unprofitable projects before they drain your cash flow.

### Real-World Examples

We use realistic construction scenarios:
- Residential home builder completing 20 homes/year
- Commercial contractor with $2M+ projects
- Specialty subcontractor (electrical, plumbing, HVAC)

### Contractor-Friendly Language

No accounting jargon without explanation. When we use terms like "over/under billing," we'll explain:
- What it means in plain English
- Why it matters to your bonding company
- How it affects your cash flow

## Key Terminology

Before diving in, let's establish common language:

| Term | Definition | Why It Matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Job Costing** | Tracking all costs associated with a specific project | Determines if jobs are profitable |
| **WIP (Work in Progress)** | Value of work completed but not yet billed | Critical for accurate financial statements |
| **Retention/Retainage** | Percentage of payment withheld until project completion | Affects cash flow and AR management |
| **Progress Billing** | Billing based on percentage of work completed | Matches revenue recognition to work performed |
| **Change Order** | Modification to original contract scope/price | Must be tracked separately for profitability analysis |
| **Over-Billing** | Billing more than work completed (liability) | Common in construction, requires proper tracking |
| **Under-Billing** | Billing less than work completed (asset) | Often indicates cash flow problems |
