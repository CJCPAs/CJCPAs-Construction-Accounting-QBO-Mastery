## 💡 Key Concepts at a Glance

### Job Costing Formula
```
Job Profitability = Job Revenue - (Labor + Materials + Subs + Equipment + Other Direct)
```

### Percentage of Completion (Cost-to-Cost)
```
% Complete = Costs Incurred to Date ÷ Total Estimated Costs
Earned Revenue = Contract Price × % Complete
```

### Over/Under Billing
```
Over-Billing = Billings to Date > Earned Revenue (Liability)
Under-Billing = Earned Revenue > Billings to Date (Asset)
```
